# TimeTrend Insights - Annual sales

## Overview
Superstores is an American-based retailer specializing in electronic appliances and accessories, including phones, laptops, and related items. The company operates in 10 cities and 8 regions.

Delve into Superstores' dynamics with 'TimeTrend Insights.' This project uncovers prime advertisement windows, examines year-round sales trends, and unveils company performance. Merging data with Python and Pandas sets the stage, followed by in-depth analysis using Google Colab and strategic tools like Prophet, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Results shine in a detailed report, crafted in PowerPoint and shared as a PDF.

## Project Structure
The project is split into three main parts:

1. Data Preparation with Python and Pandas:
Twelve CSV files containing sales data are merged, cleaned, and prepared for analysis using Python and the Pandas library.

2. Data Analysis with Google Colab:
The analysis of the prepared data and the exploration of three specific questions are conducted using Google Colab. This includes using libraries such as Prophet, NumPy, Matplotlib, and others to gain valuable insights.

3. Report Creation:
The final results and findings are presented in a report. The report is built using PowerPoint (ppt) and then saved as a PDF for easy sharing and dissemination of the results.

## Technologies Used
The project utilizes the following technologies and tools:

- Python: Used for data preparation and manipulation tasks.
- Pandas: Utilized for data cleaning, merging, and analysis.
- Google Colab: Used as the environment for data analysis, leveraging its powerful collaborative features.
- Libraries: Several Python libraries like Prophet, NumPy, and Matplotlib are employed for data analysis and visualization.
